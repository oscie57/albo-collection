# DSiDev
Development for `A little bit of... Collection`, a DSi homebrew title used for launching games via their `.nds` file and [`nds-bootstrap`](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/nds-bootstrap)

## Ideas
The DSi application will hopefully display the collection's games on the bottom screen, selectable with either stylus or D-Pad, showing information on the top screen such as release date, icon, publisher and other info.
`synopsis/{lang}/{screen}.ext`

Get the information and icons from the nds roms

Integrate [Le Fishe au Chocolat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApem1uUwpg) into the app via a secret combo or something cos funni
